# Mapping_Flooded_Area
My study area will be Harris county, Texas. Hurricane Harvey, a slow-moving Category 4 storm that
hit the Houston, Texas, region on August 26, 2017 which caused flood. I will be calculating the flooded
area using satellite data and then I will look into the monthly precipitation change and total water
storage anomaly in Harris county.

I used Google Earth Engine for mapping the flooded area.
